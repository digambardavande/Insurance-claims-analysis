Analyze insurance claims data to identify patterns, detect fraud, and support underwriting decisions using Python and real-world analytics techniques.

# 🛡️ Insurance Claims Analysis & Fraud Risk Detection Project

A real-world analytics project focused on uncovering patterns in insurance claims data, identifying suspicious claims, and supporting underwriting decisions. Built using Python, this project demonstrates core data analysis, cleaning, visualization, and anomaly detection skills.

---

## 📊 Project Objective

This project aims to:
- Analyze patterns in historical insurance claims
- Detect potential fraud using statistical and ML methods
- Provide actionable insights to support risk management and pricing

---

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Statistics**: Z-Score for outlier detection
- **Machine Learning**: Isolation Forest
- **Visualization**: Bar plots, line charts, boxplots, scatter plots
- **Documentation**: Jupyter Notebook, PowerPoint report
- *(Optional)* Excel used to share cleaned data

---

## 📁 Dataset Summary

The dataset contains historical insurance claims with the following fields:
- `claim_amount`: Value of the insurance claim
- `claim_date`: Date when the claim was filed
- `claim_type`: Type of insurance claim (e.g., accident, theft)
- `customer_age`: Age of the policyholder
- `customer_region`: Region of residence
- `total_policy_claims`: Number of claims filed under a policy

> *Note: Dataset is anonymized and uploaded only for demonstration purposes.*

## 🔍 Key Steps

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Removed missing or invalid values
- Parsed inconsistent date formats
- Cleaned monetary values (₹/$) from `claim_amount`

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Claim amount distribution
- Claim type frequency and average values
- Seasonal trend analysis
- Age-wise and region-wise claim behavior

### 3. Fraud/Suspicious Claim Detection
- **Z-Score Method**: Statistical outlier detection
- **Isolation Forest**: ML-based anomaly detection
- Visualized flagged claims with scatter plots

### 4. Recommendations
- Flag high-value claims early
- Monitor seasonal spikes
- Use ML-based early detection tools
- Refine policy pricing for high-risk groups

- ## 🎯 Business Relevance
This project simulates a typical insurance analytics 
- Reduce fraud
- Improve underwriting
- Optimize customer profiling
